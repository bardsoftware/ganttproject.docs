    Finally, if you like automation, you can convert a project document to PDF or image 
    using command-line export. It was unintentionally broken in GanttProject versions 3 dot 0 and 3 dot 1, 
    but now it is great again! Let’s try to export our project as a PNG image. 
    Okay, it worked fine, but GanttProject’s command-line is not limited to such 
    simple operations. What about exporting a GanttProject document to CSV <break time='1s'/> or 
    Microsoft Project format? Here we go! Can it convert MS Project files to images? 
    Yes, <break time='50ms'/>it can.
