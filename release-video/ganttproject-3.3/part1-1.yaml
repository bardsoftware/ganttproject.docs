    In this video we start a brief overview of the key features added in GanttProject 3.3
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    Imagine that you need to show a ticked check box against the completed tasks.
    <break time='500ms'/>
    Or maybe show the task duration in hours, provided that there
    are just 6 business hours per day?
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    You may create custom columns for such purposes, but keeping them  in sync
    with task completion or duration in days is surely troublesome.
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    GanttProject 3.3 makes it easier. You can create a custom column
    that calculates its value for each task.
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    Let's create a calculated check box. It is a boolean column, and it will
    appear ticked when this expression becomes true.
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    Let's test it! This task is not yet completed, and the checkbox is blank.
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    Now it is done, and the checkbox is ticked automatically.
    <break time='1000ms'/>
    What we can write in this expression field? It is basically an SQL expression which
    is evaluated for each task row by the real SQL database engine. Please visit
    docs web site to learn more about the syntax and supported features.
